<p><h3 style="background-color:Tomato;">I’m lucky enough to call Muninl my best brother. He is honestly the kind of person who always has my back, no matter what trouble I get into or what challenges I face. Whether we are hanging out watching movies, playing games, or just talking about life, he always knows how to make me laugh and feel supported. He constantly shows me how much he cares, like the time he showed up with an absolute mountain of food just for us. Sitting there together, eating and catching up, reminded me that he is always looking out for me in his own way; it wasn't just about the meal, but about making sure I was taken care of. Having him in my corner makes everything better, and I truly appreciate having a brother who is also my closest friend. </h3></p>
